/// @title  IPermissionIntrospection
/// @notice Optional interface that permission templates implement alongside IPermission
///         to expose stable identity and capability metadata to off-chain consumers.
///
/// @dev    This interface is OPTIONAL. Templates that implement it provide richer
///         indexing and UI support, but templates that do not implement it continue
///         to work unchanged — the kernel never calls these functions.
///
/// @dev    This is introspection only — NOT authorization. IPermission.evaluate()
///         remains the sole authorization gate. None of the functions here have any
///         effect on whether a dispatch is permitted.
///
/// @dev    permissionId identifies the template TYPE, not the deployment instance.
///         Two separate deployments of SharedBoundedSwapPermission return the same
///         permissionId. Use the contract address to distinguish instances.
///
/// @dev    Indexers and UIs can combine PermissionRegistered events emitted by the
///         kernel with permissionId() lookups to group accounts by template type,
///         track adoption, and reconstruct per-template dispatch metrics without any
///         per-dispatch on-chain overhead. See docs/off-chain-attribution.md for the
///         canonical derivation patterns.
